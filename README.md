# UIF Compliance Email Automation

A Python + Streamlit application that automates follow-up emails for compliance document requests.

## Features

- **Email Logic**: Uses SMTP server `smtp.dithetoaccountants.co.za` with sender `gamu@dithetoaccountants.co.za`
- **Email Limits**: Maximum 10 emails per company (1 initial + 9 follow-ups), then marked as "non-cooperative"
- **Progressive Templates**: Follow-up emails vary in subject lines and tone, becoming stronger with each reminder
- **Personalization**: Each email includes company's UIF Reference and Trade Name
- **CSV Data Source**: Upload CSV with `UIF_REFERENCE`, `TRADE_NAME`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS` columns
- **Batch Processing**: Select up to 30 companies per batch for email sending
- **SQLite Tracking**: Logs all email activity with timestamps and status
- **Streamlit UI**: User-friendly interface with search, filtering, and progress tracking
